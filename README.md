# 300-and-countering

This is what I am attempting to do with one of my best friends. We have completed a Spartan Race in Ohio together but nothing close to this size. I believe we can do it and complete the race in its' entirety but we will see. 300 is a lot of mileage on two folks who do not ride that often. A link to the event can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.argeorgia.com/seatosea"> here at argeorgia.com</a>

I will be showing what we have as far as mobile targets are concerned, as well as other specs on our workouts / techniques in order to complete this challenge that lays ahead of us. 

While both of us have grown up with an athletic background, I personally have taken some time away from any kind of intense, long-term, fitness activity. 

These next five + months will be challenging. I will continue to post as often as I can  just to log and help remember the journey - not only for myself but for others interested in the process it takes to potentially succeeed in completeing this crazy adventure course.

I have always had some kind of workout plan - whether I've followed it or not. There are tons of workouts here that I've come up with, and referenced other trainers.
